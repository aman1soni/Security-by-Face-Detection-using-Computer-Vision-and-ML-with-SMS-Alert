# Security-by-Face-Detection-using-Computer-Vision-and-ML

ABSTRACT:
System Security Using Face Detection is designed for motion detection and webcam monitoring. It can be used to enhance the automated security systems. It can be used to detect any fraudulent activity by sensing motion around the areas where surveillance is needed. This project will be designed with the help of image processing and OpenCV. Webcams are video cameras used for the purpose of observing an area. They are often connected to a recording device or IP network, and may be watched by a security guard or law enforcement officer. In case of location we have less percentage of movement (like home courtyard during night); then we need to check the whole recorded video to show where and when that motion occurs which are wasting in time. So, we aim at processing the real time video captured by a Webcam to detect motion in the Scene using image detection and open CV, with keeping in mind that camera still recorded which means real time detection. The results show accuracy and efficiency in detecting motion. In the application, There can be a web camera attached to the computer.

This system works on 3 phases:
        1. It captures pictures of user's face and try to authenticate in the system.
        2. then, we need to train all the captured pictures in the 1st step.
        3. Now, try a look or check up for the system. Is system authenticates right user or not.
